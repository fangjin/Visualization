Hotel rooms look out over the ocean and are cleaned daily. The pool is clean and refreshing and is included in the camp/hotel fees.

From there you can board the metro line and go anywhere in the city (the metro is very easy to use and costs 5 peso per ride). The Bus to the city costs about 40 peso and the return trip can be payed for at the north end of the north bus terminal). The owner does have about 4 dogs, two of which can bark at anything and everything all night. She will put them in their kennel upon request which really does make a huge difference to the amount of sleep you get. All sites have electricity and water (about 12 sites in total) and the water is apparently from a well. Might be an idea to still boil it. Be sure to check out the taco stand on the corner near the main market in town (it is only open at night) and is absolutely delicious!

The current park can hold maybe 4 or 5 small rigs but bigger units (25 feet +) will have troubles pulling in off the street. 100 pesos per night. They have a few dogs and chickens here, but the dogs do stay to themselves- nothing for dog haters! The camping is on a beautiful lawn, and amenities include a simple shower and electricity for small consumers (otherwise it may end up smoking from the socket). We have heard that Anita and her family make incredible authentic dishes, so if they invite you, be sure to dine with them. A bus also runs along Calle 12, that will take you quickly and easily into the historic district.","date_verified":"2015-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","category_icon_path":"/assets/icons/camping-bbf50043d2309778cdbc3cc9b7f7b80c.png","category_icon_pin_path":"/assets/icons/camping-pin-6b32dd94fc978c7943cf639964a095a8.png","amenities":{"Open":"No","Electricity":"Yes - At Sites","Internet":"No","Kitchen":"No","Restaurant":"No","Showers":"No","Water":"Non-Potable","Restroom":"No","Big Rig Friendly":"No","Tent Friendly":"Yes","Pet Friendly":"Yes"},"country":"Mexico","category":"Established Campground","location":{"latitude":-90.0,"longitude":0.0,"altitude":12.0,"horizontal_accuracy":null,"vertical_accuracy":null}},{"id":289,"name":"Fresh n Green","description":"Customized salads and baguette sandwiches.

In addition, he has some pitches for motorhomes and / or tents, cost  per night: 50 pesos per square, discount on multiple nights. The small restaurant has delicious food, a pizza oven is under construction. The whole plot is green, full of trees provide shade. He is currently building more cabanas and planting more trees. Much quieter than the other accommodations such as Pepe's, etc. Also much shadier than these! Is also the closest to the beach (about 10 minutes on foot or 2 minutes by car). Have for 2 people 50Pesos/night paid absolutely favorable for such a beautiful place! Barra de la Cruz is a well known surf. But the far right you can also bathe safely. Pay attention to the currents in large surf! You have to pay for the Beach Access 20Pesos/day/Person. Although it sounds like a rip off, but it has showers, clean toilets, parking, huge palap for a hammock, restaurant etc. there and you feel extremely safe.

There is not a lot of trees to offer shade, but there is a fantastic breeze that comes off of the water, and if parked in the right direction, will cool your van, RV or whatever. The Beach extends for kilometers down the coastline but there is not a lot of surf - Aside from the wind waves, it is pretty calm. There are tonnes of shells on the beach, and it is fun to walk the shoreline marveling at the different types and colors. The Area itself seems to be a vacation property coast with a lot of the houses on the beach either in dis-repair or upgrade. The RV park itself has fast Internet, (apparently) potable water, electricity and washrooms with showers. The Restaurant is in good condition (although we have our own food) we may hit up the little gift shop as quite a few of their items appear to be made by area artisans.

They are Boulder trails with beautiful vistas. There appears to be some climbing areas as we saw a group with ropes and supplies. Bathrooms are fairly clean and shower stall is a wooden room with pipes in thermal water. The small store carries only canned and dried goods and is rarely open.

The staff were absolutely magnificent, and went out of their way to make our stay perfect. My truck was too big for the garage so it was kept in their secure compound about 200m South of the hotel. There is a restaurant and bar in the hotel. The wifi is fast.

San Ysidro to Tijuana city center and Otay Mesa.   For day trippers to the northern end of Baja with little desire to see the actual city center in Tijuana, it makes little difference which crossing you use as long as you have your insurance in order or if you already have obtained all documents online. You may want to avoid the throngs of rush hour traffic at the San Ysidro crossing to city center Tijuana though. For people who intend to stay longer than 72 hours and therefor need a tourist card and who may want a Temporary Vehicle Import Permit, I recommend crossing at the Otay Mesa which is about 12 km east of the city center. This crossing is very easy to access via the USA side from the freeway and feeder freeways I-5 and I-805 and the 125 South Bay Expressway. \r\n\r\nOn the Mexican side the offices for TC and TVIP are very straight forward to find. After crossing it is fairly simple city driving to get to Mex 2 East or to ride into the heart of the city and find Mex 1 South.   \r\n\r\nFor those who are still undecided if they will sail to mainland MExico, the TVIP can also be obtained at the Pichilingue / La Paz ferry terminal and no TVIP is required if you take the ferry from Santa Rosalia to Guaymas. If this applies to you, you could get only the Tourist Card here. If you are certain of a La Paz ferry trip then you might as well get he TVIP here while you are stopped anyway.

ENTRANCE is unmarked dirt road just before Tripui RV Park, on the road into Puerto Escondido Marina area. Along the dirt road you'll see a sign for 'Playa El Quemado'. It was partly recently grated and some soft sandy parts closer to the beach. Road shoots off to diff areas of the beach. We stayed between a couple permanents at the north end but the beach goes a long way South, should be lots of spots. Depending where you camp could get really soft sand, but people obviously do get big trailers in there. Lots of rvs and trailers set up long term but doesnt feel like it because you have privacy in the shrubs. Felt safe.            Beautiful sunrise over the island that lights up the mountains to the west. Saw dolphins really close in the bay in the morning and orcas further out.              WATCH OUT FOR sand fleas, and the thorny bushes - especially thorny little branches hidden in the sand.        HIKING: A friendly german resident told us about some hiking trails nearby. One called 'Hart Trail' is at the north end of the beach beside the last trailer. There's a sign in the rocks at the head. Its about 1hr or so round trip. Nice view of the bays, P. Escondido, and the mountains. Recommend doing it at sunrise! Gets hot. The other one is longer, more difficult, through a canyon on the other side of hwy 1. Entrance to this hike is across the hwy from the entrance to P. Escondido down a road with a water plant or tower, there's a parking area at the trail head. Some scrambling on all fours required and one rope. Not sure how long this one is, didn't do it just heard about it.

He also took us to Cuitzeo, across the lake, which is very historic and interesting.  So much potential here!  He says he isn't officially open because he's still working with the city to get a better entrance road.  Because of that, he didn't charge us a penny to spend 2 nights with all amenities, plus a free guided tour of the area.

Good beach break to surf. We asked the neighbors if it was possible and safe to park our van and stay overnight to sleep there, and they confirmed it was fine. The people owning and working at Las Tres Carabelas are extremely friendly. They left the outside light lighten for us, and told us we could use their outdoor shower and toilets even during the night.","date_verified":"2016-04-21T13:53:02.000Z","category_icon_path":"/assets/icons/wild-camp-804698eb9f97aa1c41853da2e78b0e26.png","category_icon_pin_path":"/assets/icons/wild-camp-pin-d178ac467d26aa110e9a4a6b401c36de.png","amenities":{"Open":"Yes","Electricity":"No","Internet":"No","Kitchen":"No","Restaurant":"Yes","Showers":"Cold","Water":"No","Restroom":"Running Water","Big Rig Friendly":"No","Tent Friendly":"Unknown","Pet Friendly":"Yes"},"country":"Mexico","category":"Wild Camping","location":{"latitude":16.7430320056311,"longitude":-99.7559278552418,"altitude":5.03972911834717,"horizontal_accuracy":null,"vertical_accuracy":null}},{"id":15807,"name":"Wild Beach/ Lagoon ","description":"Beautiful beach by old abandoned fishing buildings. Not as far as the others. But it's where gps will bring you if you looking for the sea lions and arch. No one else just a few motor homes that look like permanent residence now. Lots of dead things though. A baby dauphin and bones that I assume are left from the hurricane and may sting rays and shark heads from local fishermen. Max called this Fukushima beach. But lots of awesome shells and sand dollars. Asked the cops in town and one lady and they said it was safe. A small road the goes to the right on the beach. Where I assume the sea lions are. Use 4x4 if you drive on the beach. The sand is very fine and our truck got stuck. But is a nice place with on one in site. Gets very cold at night even in late April  we Had to put a hoodie on the dog. Also the wind off the lagoon is very wet. Make sure your gear is waterproof.
